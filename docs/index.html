		After three years of research, we're proud to introduce the only browser built for rabbit holes.
		Tangent features tree-style tabs, <strong>many-worlds time travel</strong>, and other features designed for you to make sense of your tabs.
		We built Tangent in Relm4 and WebKitGTK making it among the lightest browsers for Linux.
